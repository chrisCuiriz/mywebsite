        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            This website is For my own Documentation Purposes Only:
        </p>

        <p>
            - It will provide me with a data bank to reflect on in the future
        </p>

        <p>    
            - It will make me accountable to update and learn more to update this website
        </p>    
        
        <p>
            - Expect not only for this website to contain more information but for the website itself to evolve the more I learn
        </p>

        <p>   
            - Anyone will have access to this, use it as you see fit; learn alongside me, trash on my work, compare yourself with me to be better
        </p>
